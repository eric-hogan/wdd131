            <h2>Disc Golf Rules: How the Game is Played</h2>
            
            <p>Disc golf is an exciting sport that follows a simple set of rules, making it accessible for players of all skill levels. Whether you're playing casually or competitively, understanding the basics will help you enjoy the game to its fullest.</p>
        <h3>1. The Goal of Disc Golf</h3>
            <p>Much like traditional golf, the objective of disc golf is to complete each hole in the fewest possible throws. Players start at a tee area and aim to land their disc in the metal basket, navigating obstacles along the way.<p></p>
        <h3>2. Throwing Order</h3>
            <p>- At the start of a hole, the player with the lowest score from the previous hole tees off first.</p>
            <p>- After the first throw, the player whose disc is farthest from the basket always throws next.</p>
        <h3>3. Marking & Stance</h3>
            <p>- After each throw, players must throw from the exact spot where their disc landed (known as their "lie").</p>
            <p>- When putting, players must maintain balance behind their marker disc until the throw is complete.</p>
        <h3>4. Out-of-Bounds (OB)</h3>
            <p>- If a disc lands outside the designated course area (e.g., in water, beyond marked boundaries), the player must take a penalty stroke and rethrow from the last in-bounds position.</p>
        <h3>5. Mandatory Routes ("Mandos")</h3>
            <p>- Some courses include "mandatory" obstacles, requiring players to throw their disc around or through a specific area. Failure to follow the designated route results in a penalty throw.</p>
        <h3>6. Courtesy & Etiquette</h3>
            <p>- Players should avoid distractions, allow others to throw without interference, and respect nature by keeping courses clean.</p>
            <p>- Help fellow players find lost discs and keep pace to ensure smooth play.</p>
